= Jujutsu (jj)

Jujutsu (often called jj) is a VCS designed for the stacking workflow. It has
novel features include _colocated repositories_, which can be used both as
normal Git repositories and jj repositories simultaneously.

== Starting a new stack

Create a new revision with _main_ as its parent:

[source,shell]
---
$ jj new main
---

== Pushing your changes for review

[source,shell]
---
$ jj branch create my-branch
---

== Responding to code review feedback

Use the edit workflow:

[source,shell]
---
$ jj edit REV
---

Or the squash workflow:

[source,shell]
---
$ jj new REV
$ jj squash
---
