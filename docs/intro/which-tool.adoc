= Which tool should I use?

== I don't want to learn any new tools

You can do the stacking workflow with xref:../git.adoc[stock Git]. Some
workflows will be tedious because Git's UI isn't designed for this workflow.

== I'll learn "just enough"

xref:../git-branchless.adoc[git-branchless] is a good choice to get started
becuase it adds on to an existing Git repository. New commands become available,
but all the same Git commands still work.

== I'm willing to learn a whole new tool

Choose either xref:../jj.adoc[Jujutsu] or https://sapling-scm.com/[Sapling]. I'm
partial to Jujutsu, but both tools are lovely.
