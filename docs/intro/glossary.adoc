Main branch::
The destination where reviewed revisions will land. Usually this is named
_main_, _trunk_, or _master_, but some teams may use other names like _dev_.

Stack::
A sequence of commits that eventually should land in the main branch.

Branch::
In this guide, "branch" refers _just_ to the branch pointer, not to the stack of
commits it points to. Git calls this a _ref_ or _reference_.
